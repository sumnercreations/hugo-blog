# React Bootcamp with Tyler McGinnis | Week 3 | Lifecycle of a Component
## Lifecycle
1. constructor
2. render
3. componentDidMount - this is where AJAX/API calls are made
4. componentDidUpdate
5. componentWillUnmount


The loading state solution was very interesting.

## Challenge
Build an application that allows you to select the language and it will display the most popular repositories on github for that language.
Starting point is this [gist](https://gist.github.com/tylermcginnis/e3822fb9a73ecec62c814e4a14c3229e)
